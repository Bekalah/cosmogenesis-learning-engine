## `sound/`

- Contains **harmonious atmospheric music** and **ambient textures**  
  (e.g. Skeler-style beats, dreamwave, slow reverb rock, goth atmospheres).
- Must be **free to use** under CC0, CC-BY, or similar safe license.
- Each track should include a `.txt` or `.json` provenance note:
  - Title / Source link  
  - License type  
  - Author credit (if required)  

**Example:**

sound/
dreamwave-001.mp3
dreamwave-001.json

```json
{
  “title”: “Dreamwave 001”,
  “license”: “CC0”,
  “source”: “https://example.com/dreamwave-001”,
  “author”: “Unknown (Public Domain)”
}

img/
	•	Visionary art, diagrams, grimoire illustrations.
	•	Store both raw sources and optimized web formats (.png, .webp).
	•	Each major artwork should have a provenance file if it comes from open source archives.

⸻

video/
	•	Short loops or reverb visuals.
	•	Keep size under 30MB for repo health.
	•	If a file is larger, store it externally (e.g., GitHub Releases, IPFS, or cloud storage).
	•	Always include provenance info.

⸻

fonts/
	•	Only fonts licensed under SIL, CC0, or OFL.
	•	Avoid proprietary fonts.
	•	Keep provenance and license files alongside font files.

⸻

ND-Safe Rules
	•	No autoplay audio by default.
	•	Volume defaults to low for accessibility.
	•	All assets must respect accessibility:
	•	Calm colors
	•	Optional playback
	•	Captions / alt text

⸻

Provenance & Licensing
	•	Every asset must be traceable to its license.
	•	Use CC0 (public domain) or CC-BY (attribution) wherever possible.
	•	Attribution should be lightweight but clear — e.g., a credit note in the About tab.
