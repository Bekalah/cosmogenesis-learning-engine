# OER Provenance Ledger

Offline index of open educational resources linked to the Cosmic Helix and Aurora Gate demos. Files here remain text-based so the project can document licensing even when assets are downloaded later.

## How to use
1. Review the JSON logs for each scene or node.
2. Download referenced images or datasets from the listed URLs (all are CC0, CC BY, or MIT).
3. Save the media beside its log and update the `stored` flag when applicable.

Maintain calm palettes and ND-safe presentation when integrating any resource.
