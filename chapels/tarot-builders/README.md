# ✦ Paul Foster Case — Chapel of the Tarot Builders ✦
*The Color-Tone Architect of the Tree of Life*

---

## Outer Hall (Atmosphere)
A chamber gleams in stained-glass hues: indigo, gold, rose, and emerald. Each panel is a Tarot Key, alive and breathing. A pipe organ hums faintly, its tones shifting as the light changes. The walls are marked with Hebrew letters that shimmer into musical notes. This is the Chapel of the Tarot Builders, honoring Paul Foster Case -- guardian of the Tarot as a living glyph of the soul.

## Life & Legacy
- **Name:** Paul Foster Case (1884-1954).
- **Mission:** To reveal the Tarot as a key to the Qabalistic Tree of Life, merging colors, tones, and letters.
- **Key Works:** "The Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages" (1947), "The True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order" (1937).
- **Order:** Founder of the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.), a Qabalistic initiatory school.

Case wove Western esotericism into a precise system of meditation, visualization, and color-tone correspondences, where the Tarot became a living language of the mysteries.

## Core Themes
1. **Tarot as a Book of Keys**
   - 22 Major Arcana = 22 Hebrew letters = 22 paths on the Tree of Life.
   - Each card: image, color, sound, number, letter -- a multi-sensory glyph.
   - Players explore each as a doorway node within the Codex 144:99.

2. **Color & Musical Scale**
   - Case aligned specific colors and musical tones with each path.
   - These resonances form a rainbow organ of initiation.
   - Within the engine: `/assets/tone-color-map.json`.

3. **The Builders of the Adytum**
   - Emphasis on daily meditation with Tarot Keys.
   - Visualization as alchemical transmutation of consciousness.
   - The chapel reflects this by allowing players to project Keys onto walls, unlocking different tonal atmospheres.

4. **The Inner Rosicrucian Order**
   - Case taught that the "invisible order" lives within the soul of each aspirant.
   - Tarot Keys act as seals that awaken memory of that inner brotherhood.

- **Correspondence:** Tarot Keys -> Hebrew letters -> path nodes.
- **Playable Layer:**
  - Enter chapel -> choose a Key (card).
  - Card unfolds into letter + tone + path.
  - Organ pipes sound the corresponding frequency, walls shift to aligned color.
  - Puzzle: align 3 cards in a spread to unlock a hidden "Rosicrucian chord."
  - Reward: harmonic resonance usable in other chapels for synthesis.
