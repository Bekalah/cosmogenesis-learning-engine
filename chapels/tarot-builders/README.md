## Outer Hall (Atmosphere)

A chamber gleams in stained-glass hues: indigo, gold, rose, and emerald. Each panel is a Tarot Key, alive and breathing. A pipe organ hums faintly, its tones shifting as the light changes. The walls are marked with Hebrew letters that shimmer into musical notes. This is the **Chapel of the Tarot Builders**, honoring Paul Foster Case — guardian of the Tarot as a living glyph of the soul.

## Core Themes

1. **Tarot as a Book of Keys**  
   - 22 Major Arcana = 22 Hebrew letters = 22 paths on the Tree of Life.  
   - Each card: image, color, sound, number, letter — a multi-sensory glyph.  
   - Players explore each as a **doorway node** within the Codex 144:99.  

2. **Color & Musical Scale**  
   - Case aligned specific colors and musical tones with each path.  
   - These resonances form a rainbow organ of initiation.  
   - Within the engine: `/assets/tone-color-map.json`.  

3. **The Builders of the Adytum**  
   - Emphasis on daily meditation with Tarot Keys.  
   - Visualization as alchemical transmutation of consciousness.  
   - The chapel reflects this by allowing players to project Keys onto walls, unlocking different tonal atmospheres.  

4. **The Inner Rosicrucian Order**  
   - Case taught that the "invisible order" lives within the soul of each aspirant.  
   - Tarot Keys act as seals that awaken memory of that inner brotherhood.
