Offline, ND-safe canvas sketch for layered sacred geometry.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server needed).
2. A 1440×900 canvas renders four static layers:
Static HTML and Canvas were chosen so the geometry renders locally without
network calls or heavy libraries, keeping the experience deterministic and
motion-free.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server needed).
2. A 1440×900 canvas renders four static layers:
   - **Vesica field** — intersecting circles forming the womb of forms.
   - **Tree‑of‑Life scaffold** — ten sephirot with twenty‑two straight paths.
<<<   - **Tree-of-Life scaffold** — ten sephirot with twenty-two straight paths.
   - **Fibonacci curve** — golden spiral polyline anchored to centre.
   - **Double-helix lattice** — two phase-shifted sine tracks.

3. Palette can be customized in `data/palette.json`. Missing data triggers a gentle inline notice with safe defaults.

## ND-safe notes

- Static drawing; no animation or autoplay.
- Calm contrast palette reduces sensory strain.
- Layer order clarifies depth without flashing.
- Geometry parameters lean on numerology constants 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.

## Design Notes
- Static HTML and Canvas keep rendering local and deterministic.
- Geometry routines live in `js/helix-renderer.mjs` with small pure functions and ASCII quotes only.
- Numerology constants live in `index.html` and are passed to the renderer so symbolic values remain explicit.
## Design notes
- No animation, autoplay, or flashing; a single render call ensures ND safety.
- Muted colors and generous spacing improve readability in dark and light modes.
- Geometry routines use numerology constants (3,7,9,11,22,33,99,144) to honour
  project canon.
- Numerology constants live in `index.html` and are passed to the renderer so the
  symbolic values remain explicit and easy to tweak.
- Code is modular ES module (`js/helix-renderer.mjs`) with pure functions and
  ASCII quotes only.

## Extending
The renderer is intentionally minimal. Future layers or overlays can be added by
extending `renderHelix` with new draw functions while preserving the calm visual
hierarchy.

## Task List
- [ ] Weave cathedral-scale vesica grids to frame expansive worlds.
- [ ] Map Tree-of-Life nodes to sanctuaries like Avalon and mountain temples.
- [ ] Layer Fibonacci paths through oceans, rivers, and volcanic corridors.
- [ ] Cross-link double-helix lattices with rune, tarot, and reiki lore.
- [ ] Keep all additions ND-safe: no motion, high contrast, pure functions.

## Extending

The renderer is intentionally minimal. Future layers or overlays can be added by extending `renderHelix` with new draw functions while preserving the calm visual hierarchy.
## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser; no server or network required.
2. A 1440×900 canvas renders four static layers:
   - **Vesica field** — intersecting circles forming a calm grid.
   - **Tree-of-Life scaffold** — ten sephirot connected by twenty-two paths.
   - **Fibonacci curve** — golden spiral polyline anchored to centre.
   - **Double-helix lattice** — two phase‑shifted sine tracks.
3. Palette can be customized in `data/palette.json`. If the file is missing, the renderer falls back to a safe default and shows a gentle notice.

## ND-safe notes
- Static drawing; no animation, autoplay, or flashing.
- Soft contrast palette and generous spacing improve readability.
- Layer order clarifies depth without motion.
- Geometry routines lean on numerology constants 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.

## Design notes
- Pure ES modules with ASCII quotes only.
- Code lives in `js/helix-renderer.mjs`; geometry functions are small and well commented.
- Everything works offline by double‑clicking `index.html`.

## Extending
The renderer is intentionally minimal. New layers or overlays can be added by extending `renderHelix` while preserving the calm visual hierarchy and ND‑safe choices.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server needed).
2. A 1440×900 canvas draws four static layers:
   - **Vesica field** — grid of intersecting circles.
   - **Tree-of-Life scaffold** — ten sephirot with twenty-two paths.
   - **Fibonacci curve** — golden spiral polyline anchored to the centre.
   - **Double-helix lattice** — two phase-shifted sine tracks.
3. Palette can be changed in `data/palette.json`. If missing, a safe default palette loads and a notice appears.

## ND-safe notes
- Static drawing only; no animation or autoplay.
- Calm contrast palette reduces sensory strain.
- Layer order clarifies depth without flashing.
- Geometry routines use numerology constants 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144.

## Design notes
- Pure ES module (`js/helix-renderer.mjs`) with small, well-commented functions.
- ASCII quotes only, UTF-8, LF newlines.

## Extending
Add new draw functions in `js/helix-renderer.mjs` while preserving ND-safe layer order.

   - **Tree-of-Life scaffold** - ten sephirot with twenty-two paths.
   - **Fibonacci curve** - golden spiral polyline anchored to centre.
   - **Double-helix lattice** - two phase-shifted sine tracks.

Palette values live in `data/palette.json`. If the file is missing, the renderer falls back to a safe internal palette and shows a small notice.

## ND-safe notes

## Extending
Add more layers by extending `renderHelix` with additional draw functions while preserving the calm visual hierarchy.
