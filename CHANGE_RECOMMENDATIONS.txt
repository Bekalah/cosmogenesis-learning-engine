1. Extract core logic into a dedicated `cosmogenesis_core` package exposed via a clean API for reuse across repositories.
2. Share dependencies using a single `requirements.txt` and common `package.json` to keep environments consistent.
3. Structure repositories as lightweight plugins or services that call into the core engine.
4. Provide Docker containers or dev environments based on the core image to ensure reproducibility.
5. Implement CI pipelines that run tests against the shared engine for early compatibility checks.
6. Maintain centralized documentation and examples demonstrating how client repos integrate with the engine.
7. Deduplicate duplicate script keys in `package.json` to avoid overrides (`dev` and `test` defined twice).
8. Ensure all repositories include tests executed with `node --test` and Python linting for consistency.
