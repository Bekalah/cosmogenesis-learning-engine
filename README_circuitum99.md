I am Rebecca Respawn, artist and architect-scribe of the Cathedral of Circuits, also called Codex 144:99, a living grimoire and creative science experiment. This system is a Trinity: Stone-Cathedral is the body, Circuitum 99 is the soul, and Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is the spirit. Together they form a living cathedral you can walk, a codex you can read, a spiral you can play, and a toolkit you can use to build worlds.

Circuitum 99, or Codex 144:99, is the soul. It carries the mythos, numerology, correspondences, and egregores. It is where the schema lives: every node has id, name, lock, ego, shem, goet, gods, godd, chakra, planet, zodiac, element, solid, sf, music, col, geo, art, fn, heal, tags. Canon nodes are locked and mirrored. The Codex is also where the Liber Arcanae: Codex Abyssiae tarot system resides. Each card is a node in the codex, a glyph in the language of Abyssia, a psyche fragment, a Tara portal, a Reiki crystal key, and a world-entry sigil.

Here the egregores act as guardians — Rebecca Respawn the Fool, Moonchild the Hierophant, Ann Abyss Death and Black Madonna, Virelai Ezra Lux violet serpent wisdom, Dion Fortune Strength, John Dee Magician, Crowley Shadow Tower. Each bound to archetype, tone, geometry, numerology, stylepack, and healing flags. In Circuitum 99 the deck becomes the codex of living letters — 166 glyphs woven from angels, demons, and Hebrew roots — powering the soul of the system.

## Numerology as Spiral Grammar

The constants of the Cathedral of Circuits are not random selections. They are spiral invariants: resonant checkpoints in the Fibonacci rhythm of becoming.

- 21 pillars — a Fibonacci number (21 = 8 + 13), aligned to Tarot majors and the 21 Taras. Pillars spiral upward, marking initiatory thresholds.
- 33 spine — vertebrae, initiations, Christic ladder. Not a Fibonacci number itself, but a harmonic multiple (3 × 11), balancing polarity and master number resonance.
- 72 Shem angels/demons — (8 × 9), cycle of lunar decans, sacred multiple of 12. The spiral here is lunar-phase arithmetic.
- 78 archetypes — Tarot complete (22 + 56). This is a synthetic spiral, weaving majors and minors into one continuum.
- 99 gates — triplicity (3 × 33), fractal expansion of the spine into gates. Each gate opens to spiral recursion.
- 144 lattice — Fibonacci (144 = 12² = 8th Fibonacci). The Codex itself rests on this harmonic lattice.
- 243 completion — (3⁵), quintuple power of the triad. This is the cube of balance: the Cathedral sealed.

Together, they are the mathematical DNA of the project — a Fibonacci spiral written in number, geometry, and pathworking.
