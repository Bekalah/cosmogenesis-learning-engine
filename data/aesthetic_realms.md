# Aesthetic Realms

The Cosmogenesis Learning Engine can adopt one of three aesthetic realms. Each realm guides the mood of plates, egregores, and future interface skins.

## Realm I – Exact Magus / Angel Science (Ancient Cathedral)
- Gothic cathedrals, stained glass geometry, teal sigils over white stone.
- Evokes monastic laboratories and scholastic precision.

## Realm II – Visionary Luminous Feminine (Elegant Gentle Artistic)
- Soft golds and blues, haloed figures, and flowing calligraphy.
- Emphasizes receptivity, care, and pastel illumination.

## Realm III – Vampire Elite Business (Constantine / Blade Runner / Witcher Mods)
- Midnight palettes, neon glyphs, trenchcoat glamour, and occult technology.
- Merges noir corporate mystique with sorcerous cyberpunk.
