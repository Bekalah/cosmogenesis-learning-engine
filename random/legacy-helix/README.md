# Legacy Helix Renderers

The files inside this folder capture earlier HTML + Canvas renderers that pre-date the current `cosmic-helix/` module. They remain available for archival reference but are not part of the active Vite + React delivery path.

- `root-offline/` mirrors the former repository root renderer.
- `helix/` contains an intermediate refactor of the same concept.
- `docs/helix/` stores documentation snapshots that assumed a docs-only layout.
- `test/` retains the Node-based smoke test for the legacy renderer.

For production use, prefer the maintained implementation in `cosmic-helix/`.
