Abstract: Codex 144:99 implements a double-tree Jacob’s Ladder spiral with 144 nodes. Each node encodes: Shem angel, Goetia daemon, cross-cultural gods/goddesses, kabbalistic attributions, platonic solids, solfeggio harmonics, and a deterministic art+music signature. Nodes combine (Indra’s Net logic) to render worlds, music, rituals, and scenes useful for creative expression and ND/PTSD-safe inner work.
Related Lineages/Contexts: Hermeticism & alchemy, Thelema (Crowley/PFC/Dion Fortune lineage contexts), Golden Dawn/Alpha & Omega, Rosicrucian, Theosophic, folk magic, I-Ching, double Tree of Life/Jacob’s Ladder, 72 Shem & Goetia, planetary and zodiacal arts.
Ethics & Safety: All high-charge nodes include crystal-clear ND/PTSD flags & usage notes. Consent containers are explicit for sacred kink nodes. Data is locked & rule-generated to prevent drift.
