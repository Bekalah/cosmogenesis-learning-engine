## ✦ What This Is

The **Cosmogenesis Learning Engine** is not a syllabus, a chart, or a flat textbook.  
It is a **living, spiral-based system of learning** — designed for artists, mystics, researchers, and anyone who learns best in dynamic, recursive ways.

- Generate **Cosmogenesis Plates** (Monad → Spiral → Ring → Border).  
- Import your own data (concepts, texts, correspondences, archives).  
- Explore **modes of 7, 12, 22, 33, 72** (planets, zodiac, paths, spine, angelic currents).  
- Export as **SVG / PNG**, or save to a local gallery.  
- Share or import configurations via JSON.  
- **ND-safe & accessible**: calm visuals, no autoplay, witness-based “Ward Mode.”  
- **Works offline, in any browser** — zero installs required.

## ✦ Why Spirals?

Flat systems fail spiral minds.  
Learning is not a line; it is a **return, a turning, an evolution**.

- Yeats tried to map the daimon with two cones.  
- Blavatsky tried to weave traditions into a system.  
- Crowley tabulated correspondences in Liber 777.  
- Kunz and af Klint drew living geometries.  

This engine continues their dream — but instead of freezing the wisdom, it **lets it live, spiral, and evolve**.

## ✦ Who It’s For

- **Artists & Designers** → turn archives into living diagrams.  
- **Mystics & Researchers** → trace correspondences across traditions.  
- **Educators & Facilitators** → run workshops with one-click demos.  
- **Neurodivergent Learners** → experience spiral, recursive teaching instead of flat steps.  
- **Trauma Survivors** → explore patterns in safe, ND-sensitive space.

## ✦ How It Works

1. **Build a Plate**  
   Choose mode (7 planets, 12 zodiac, 22 paths, etc.). Adjust spiral turns, radius, and node size.  

2. **Add Data**  
   Import your own JSON labels or paste text directly.  

3. **Render & Export**  
   See your plate come alive. Export as SVG/PNG with provenance plaque.  

4. **Evolve**  
   Unlock new stylepacks (Venus Net, Rilke Slate) through continued use.  

5. **Spiral Learning**  
   Every time you return, the system grows with you.

## ✦ Provenance Standards

Every plate, every demo, every artifact includes a **provenance plaque**:

- **Intention** → why this plate exists.  
- **Technique** → how it was made.  
- **Lineage** → which traditions, archives, or artists inform it.  
- **Reflection** → what it reveals, what it transforms.  

These standards are drawn from the **Stone Grimoire** and **Cathedral of Circuits** projects, ensuring museum-grade quality and respect for source lineages.

## ✦ Why It Matters

- For those excluded by flat education, this engine opens a new path: **learning in spirals**.  
- For creatives, it is a **professional-grade, sponsor-ready tool** for building living art from real archives.  
- For the public, it is **open-source and accessible**: a cathedral of knowledge you can walk into, remix, and share.
