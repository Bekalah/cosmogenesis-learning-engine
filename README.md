 +*A spiral teacher for living art, pattern recognition, and visionary learning.*
 +
 +Created by **Rebecca Respawn** – architect-scribe of the Cosmogenesis project.
 +
 +## Overview
 +The Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is a browser-native app for spiral learning. It transforms ideas, texts, or archives into living plates—interactive diagrams that reveal hidden patterns. Built for artists, mystics, educators, and anyone who learns beyond linear paths.
 +
 +## Features
 +- Plate Builder — generate spirals, twin-cones, wheels, or grids
 +- Any Dataset — paste text, JSON, CSV, or archives; the engine adapts
 +- Export — save plates as SVG/PNG or share JSON configs
 +- Gallery — save your own collection locally
 +- ND-Safe — no autoplay, calm motion, optional Ward Mode
 +- Offline-Ready — open `index.html` in any browser; no install required
 +- Plugins — add open knowledge connectors or generative art modules
 +- Egregore Tarot — summon helper personas as learning companions
 +- Trauma-aware — see `docs/neurodivergent_learning.md` for ND & PTSD guidance
 +- Experience Modules — explore realms like Hypatia's Library, Tesla's Workshop, Agrippa's Study, and the Alexandrian Scriptorium
