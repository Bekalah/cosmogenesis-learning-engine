Codex 144:99 — Alpha et Omega

Master Entry Document

Vision:
Codex 144:99 (Alpha et Omega) is a spiral-dynamic, nonlinear learning environment.
It is designed as a living cathedral — a fusion of art, science, and archetypal support — where users can explore creativity, healing, and knowledge through immersive environments.

This is not ritual software. It is a visionary art + learning engine.
It mirrors the architecture of the Double Tree of Life, the 33-node Living Spine, and the Tesseract, re-imagined as interactive creative tools.

Core Directories:
	•	app/  (shared modules and experiences A–D)
	•	assets/  (CC0 / public-domain sound, image, video links only)
	•	docs/
	•	engines/  (JacobsLadder, ApprenticePillar, Tesseract, Cymatics, FusionArt)
	•	plugins/
	•	scripts/
	•	src/
	•	styles/

Rule: Never erase or flatten. Extend only.

Engines:

JacobsLadder Engine
	•	33-node spiral staircase.
	•	Functions: mount, rotate, addNode, renderTo.

ApprenticePillar Engine
	•	Six consecration guardians mapped to the pillar.
	•	Functions: initializePillar, activateGuardian, renderPillar.

Tesseract Engine
	•	4D cube overlay linking experiences A–D.
	•	Functions: mount, transform, linkExperience.

Cymatics Lab
	•	Audio → resonance visualizations.
	•	Functions: applySound, generatePattern, renderPattern.

Fusion Art Engine
	•	Generates visionary, alchemical art (geometry + color palettes).
	•	Functions: generateArt, exportArt.

⸻

Labs & Experiences:
	•	Experiences A–D: nonlinear “rooms” for exploration.
	•	Binaural & Type Beat Lab: link CC0 / public-domain beats, sync with Cymatics visuals.
	•	Fusion Labs: experimental art + geometry overlays.

Principles:
	•	Nonlinear > Linear
	•	Experiential > Didactic
	•	Archetypal > Personal
	•	Fusion > Reduction
	•	Healing > Exploitation

⸻

Guardrails for Codex:
	•	Do not inject rituals or personal belief systems.
	•	Archetypes = symbolic, supportive, artistic.
	•	Real code only (JS/TS, WebGL, Three.js, React).
	•	Modular, extendable design.
	•	Always comment: // ✦ Codex 144:99 — preserve original intention

⸻

Task Flow for Codex:
	1.	Review this document before writing code.
	2.	Extend engines/ with modular classes and APIs.
	3.	Never erase symbolic mappings or original intentions.
	4.	Add assets only if open-source / CC0 / public-domain.
	5.	Test with npm run dev.

⸻

Example Prompt for Codex:
Implement a function in engines/Cymatics.js called applySound(url) that loads an audio file from a public-domain URL, generates a real-time waveform using the Web Audio API, and maps it onto a spiral grid in the JacobsLadder engine.

⸻

Final Note:
Codex 144:99 is a living system. Always preserve its spine, expand its body, and never overwrite its soul.

This is one single, clean file you can paste in as README.md or CODEX_ENTRY.md.
