# ✦ Codex 144:99 — Cosmogenesis Learning Engine
_A living, visionary art grimoire and immersive learning experiment_

—

## 🌌 What This Is
Codex 144:99 (Alpha et Omega) is an **immersive learning engine** for creative, non-linear exploration.  
It combines **visionary art, archetypal psychology, and open science** into a unified framework.

Think:  
**Alice in Wonderland** + **spiral dynamics** + **fusion art engines** + **neurodivergent-safe learning tools**.

## ✨ Core Features
- **33 Living Spine** — spiral nodal system for immersive archetypal flow.  
- **Double Tree of Life** — mirrored lattice for symbolic and structural learning.  
- **Tesseract Labyrinth** — hypercube exploration chamber for multi-dimensional learning.  
- **Cymatic Engine** — sound frequencies generate live fractal & geometric patterns.  
- **Binaural Lab** — type beats, 808s, slow-reverb soundscapes, binaural audio.  
- **Archetypal Avatars** — Archangels of Consecration, daimons, guardians as interactive guides.  
- **Spiral Nodes** — non-linear pathways for curiosity-driven knowledge.

## 🚀 Getting Started
No strict dependency manager is enforced — **this codex blends Python, JS, and open assets**.  
Set up what you need per engine:

- **Python (fractal / Pillow tools)** → `requirements.txt`  
- **JavaScript engines (cymatics, tesseract)** → `package.json`  
- **Assets** → free/open source sound, art, type beats  

Run modules individually or link them together in `app/`.

—

## 🌐 Roadmap
- [ ] Connect cymatic & binaural engines into `experience_B/`  
- [ ] Add Tesseract explorer under `experience_C/`  
- [ ] Build archetypal avatar interactions in `experience_D/`  
- [ ] Publish free-to-use type beat sound links in `assets/`  
- [ ] Sponsor-ready immersive demo site
