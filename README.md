- --- **Plate Builder** — generate spirals, twin-cones, wheels, or grids.  
- --- **Any Dataset** — paste text, JSON, CSV, or archives; the engine adapts.  
- --- **Export** — save plates as SVG/PNG or share JSON configs.  
- --- **Gallery** — save your own collection locally.  
- --- **ND-Safe** — no autoplay, calm motion, optional Ward Mode.
