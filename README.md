# ✦ Cosmogenesis Learning Engine

*A spiral teacher for living art, pattern recognition, and visionary learning.*

—

## ✦ Overview
The **Cosmogenesis Learning Engine** is a browser-native app for **spiral learning**.  
It transforms ideas, texts, or archives into **living plates** — interactive diagrams that reveal hidden patterns.

This project exists for artists, mystics, educators, and anyone who cannot learn in flat, linear ways.  
It is built to be **dynamic, recursive, and healing**: every return deepens the pattern.

## ✦ Features
- **Plate Builder** — generate spirals, twin-cones, wheels, or grids.  
- **Any Dataset** — paste text, JSON, CSV, or archives; the engine adapts.  
- **Export** — save plates as SVG/PNG or share JSON configs.  
- **Gallery** — save your own collection locally.  
- **ND-Safe** — no autoplay, calm motion, optional Ward Mode.  
- **Offline-Ready** — open `index.html` in any browser; no install required.

## ✦ Why It Matters
- For **artists & designers**: a tool to turn archives into living art.  
- For **mystics & researchers**: a way to trace correspondences across traditions.  
- For **educators & facilitators**: an interactive, non-linear teaching aid.  
- For **neurodivergent learners**: a system that respects spiral, recursive learning.
