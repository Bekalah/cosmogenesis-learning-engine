# ✦ Codex 144:99 — Cosmogenesis Learning Engine

A nonlinear, trauma-aware, archetypal learning engine built as a **spiral/tesseract system**.  
It merges **art, alchemy, science, and ND-safe design** into a living Codex.  
Codex 144:99 is both **tool and artwork**: a visionary system for immersive education, archetypal exploration, and creative healing.

## ✦ Vision
- Create an **immersive world** that feels like Alice in Wonderland meets a tesseract classroom.
- Build **nonlinear pathways** (spiral dynamics, monadic nodes) instead of linear “school oppression.”
- Support **creative ND minds** (PTSD, CPTSD, trauma-affected) through affirming, exploratory labs.
- Merge **science + art + archetypes** into usable tools.

## ✦ Core Features
- **Spiral Dynamics Engine** → nodes unfold in loops and returns, not straight lines.
- **33 Spine Monad System** → a lattice of archetypes, daimons, angels, and rays.
- **Labs**:
  - **Fusion Lab** → alchemy of art + science.
  - **Cymatics Engine** → sound, resonance, geometry.
  - **Binaural Station** → ND-safe beats, bilateral sound, regulation.
  - **Visionary Studio** → archetypal avatars, fusion art.
- **Archetypal Support** → avatars mirror the user like an archetypal community.
- **ND Safety** → reduced overwhelm, toggleable sensory layers, affirmation-based design.

## ✦ Notes for Codex / Collaborators
- Always **use real code scaffolds** (JS, Python, CSS, HTML).  
- **Never erase** original intentions in files. Layer new features *on top*.  
- Preserve **archetypal correspondences** and **node mappings** across engines.
