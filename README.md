# Cosmogenesis Learning Engine

*A spiral teacher for living art, pattern recognition, and visionary learning.*

Created by **Rebecca Susan Lemke** (Rebecca Respawn) – architect‑scribe of the Cosmogenesis project.

## Overview

The **Cosmogenesis Learning Engine** is a browser-native app for spiral learning. It transforms ideas, texts, or archives into living plates—interactive diagrams that reveal hidden patterns. This project exists for artists, mystics, educators, and anyone who cannot learn in flat, linear ways.

## Features

- Plate Builder — generate spirals, twin-cones, wheels, or grids.
- Any Dataset — paste text, JSON, CSV, or archives; the engine adapts.
- Export — save plates as SVG/PNG or share JSON configs.
- Gallery — save your own collection locally.
- ND-Safe — no autoplay, calm motion, optional Ward Mode.
- Offline-Ready — open `index.html` in any browser; no install required.
- Plugins — load open knowledge connectors or generative art modules on demand.
- Egregore Tarot — summon helper personas as learning companions.
- Trauma-aware — see `docs/neurodivergent_learning.md` for ND & PTSD guidance.
- Experience Modules — step into realms like Hypatia's Library, Tesla's Workshop, Agrippa's Study, and the Alexandrian Scriptorium.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository and open the project directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Load sample demos or craft your own dataset.

Sample datasets live in `data/`. Plugins reside in `plugins/`. Experience modules are under `app/`.

## Development

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

### Visionary Fractal Art

Generate a museum‑quality Julia set infused with Alex Grey hues:

```bash
python3 scripts/visionary_fractal.py --width 1920 --height 1080
```

The image saves as `Visionary_Dream.png` in the project root.
