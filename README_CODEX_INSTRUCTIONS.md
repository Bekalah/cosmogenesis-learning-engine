✦ Purpose

This codex is an adaptive, nonlinear learning environment for survivors of chronic PTSD, ND learners, and seekers of fusion-joy.
It heals by blending:
	•	Neuroscience & Psychology → evidence-based scaffolding for flow, DMN healing, and crafts therapy.
	•	Sacred Geometry & Hermetic Science → golden ratio, vesica piscis, Platonic solids, numerology (11/2), Thelemic principles.
	•	Mystical Archetypes → Violet Witch (Virelai Ezra Lux), Quan Yin, Violet Flame Reiki currents.
	•	Creative Technology → ND-safe audio, geometry engines, adaptive graph nodes.

The result: a living cathedral and spiral atelier where science and mysticism co-create healing.
