# Bridge of Eight — Octagram Chapels

The bridge of eight forms the antahkarana corridor linking art, magic, science, psychology, quantum research, psycho-occult study, pattern-research, and Tara devotion. Each chapel is ND-safe: no strobe, no autoplay, only soft fades, fog-light ambience, and trauma-informed pacing. Touching any chapel seal toggles the octagram tesseract system with the intensity slider enabled.

## Chapel Notes

1. **Moonchild Seal** — Indigo fog, library hush, calm vesica projections. The seal gently illuminates the vesica field while activating node `C144N-001`.
2. **Catharsis Beacon** — Amber warning glow, stabilized lightning motifs, deep drone under 40hz. Activates node `C144N-002` and affirms safe-stop protocols.
3. **Oracle Veil** — Silver mist curtains, reflective pools, binaural water bells. Activates node `C144N-003` and surfaces soft divination prompts.
4. **Pathfinder Gate** — Aurora haze with gentle wind harp accompaniment. Activates node `C144N-004` and opens opt-in adventure threads.
5. **Weaver Loom** — Copper sparks suspended in fog, harmonium chords. Activates node `C144N-005` and displays correspondence weaving overlays.
6. **Choir Atrium** — Rose gold breaths, humming choir loops, zero strobe. Activates node `C144N-006` and seats visitors for restorative rituals.
7. **Archive Tribunal** — Cool teal light, measured strings, parchment textures. Activates node `C144N-007` and shows compliance dashboards.
8. **Radiant Well** — Opal glow, soft drone, water mirrors. Activates node `C144N-008` and streams Tara blessings.
