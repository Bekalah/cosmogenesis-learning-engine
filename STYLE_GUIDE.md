# Style Guide

This project is ND-safe and offline-first. All contributors must honor the following guidelines when writing code, data, or prose.

## ND-Safe Constraints

- **No motion or strobe**: avoid autoplay, flashing, or rapid transitions.
- **Calm contrast**: use high readability colors and respect user preferences.
- **Layered geometry**: preserve depth; do not flatten art sources.
- **ASCII quotes, UTF-8, LF**: ensure files use standard quotes, UTF-8 encoding, and line feeds only.

## Formatting

- JavaScript and JSON are formatted with Prettier (`npm run fmt`).
- Linting uses ESLint (`npm run lint`) with configs per submodule.
- Small, pure functions with generous comments explaining design choices and ND-safe rationale.
