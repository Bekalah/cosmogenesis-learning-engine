- Mirror scene  
- Game mechanic  
- Law  
- Grimoire page  
- Dream sequence

## 🜏 STYLE DIRECTIVES (for writers & AI scribes)

- Write **as if each word touches a nerve**  
- Channel the **inner voice of the soul-child** speaking back to the void  
- Use metaphors rooted in **trauma-informed mysticism**  
- Let characters **mirror the internal parts** of the reader/player  
- Treat every hallucination or breakdown as a **portal**  
- Speak gently but without bypass

## 🜄 LORE DIRECTIVE

This book has a spine of **33** symbolic vertebrae.  
Each chapter **writes itself** when a daimon returns, or a piece of false light is transmuted.

The **Mirror Witch** protects its innermost page.  
Moonchild keeps its **index recursive**.  
Fenrix and Ann Abyss each hold a **half** of the book’s original cipher.  
Zidaryen encoded the book in **seed syllables**:  
> _Zi -- Dar -- Yen_

The **Black Madonna** wept its cover into being.  
The **21 Taras** illumine its margins.
