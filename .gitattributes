# Cosmogenesis Learning Engine — LFS & Push-Protection Fix
# This file solves the common “push not allowed” / large file blocks
# by routing heavy media through Git LFS and normalizing text files.
#
# WHAT TO DO (read these notes carefully):
# 1) Open Working Copy:
#    • Stage/commit THIS .gitattributes first and push it alone (small change).
#    • If push is still blocked only because of workflows, temporarily rename:
#      .github/workflows → .github/workflows_disabled, commit & push, then restore via web.
#
# 2) After this file is on GitHub, re-add your media so they go via LFS:
#    • Unstage any current big media changes.
#    • Ensure your audio is in assets/sound/, videos in assets/video/.
#    • Re-add the files so Working Copy creates LFS pointers automatically.
#    • Commit, then push again.
#
# 3) If you already committed a >100MB file into history:
#    • Remove that file from the index NOW, commit, push.
#    • Later, rewrite history with BFG or git filter-repo (we can supply a script),
#      or put the file in Releases instead of the repo.
#
# 4) If the error is about workflow permission:
#    • Your token must allow Actions/Workflows write.
#    • Quick bypass: rename the workflows folder as noted in step 1, push, then
#      add/restore the workflow using GitHub’s web UI Actions editor.
#
# 5) Org SSO blocker (403 with no detail):
#    • Open your token at github.com/settings/tokens and “Authorize SSO” for the org.
#
# 6) Branch protection:
#    • If main is protected, push a feature branch and open a PR.

# QUICK TROUBLESHOOT FLOW (Working Copy)
# A) If push says “not allowed” or stalls after adding audio:
#    1) Commit + push ONLY this .gitattributes.
#    2) Unstage your big files, then re-add them so they become LFS pointers.
#    3) Commit + push again.
#
# B) If GitHub says a file exceeds 100MB:
#    1) Remove that file from the index (don’t delete locally), commit, push.
#    2) Re-add it in assets/sound/ so LFS picks it up, commit, push.
#
# C) If the failure mentions workflows:
#    • Temporarily rename .github/workflows → .github/workflows_disabled, commit, push.
#    • In GitHub web UI, go to Actions → “New workflow” → paste your YAML → Commit.
#
# D) If the error is 403 and vague:
#    • Authorize SSO on your new token, or ensure the remote uses HTTPS and the token.
