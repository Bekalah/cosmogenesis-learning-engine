Threads glimmer with stories from across time:

- **Tibetan Raku Kei** – modern interpretations tie Reiki to Himalayan mantra and symbol lore.
- **Usui Reiki** – Japanese Buddhist Mikao Usui systematized this approach to universal life energy in 1922.
- **Karuna Reiki** – introduced by William Lee Rand in the 1990s, drawing on the Sanskrit idea of compassionate action.
- **Seichim / Sekhem** – practices inspired by the Egyptian term for vital force, echoing temple traditions of Hathor.
- **Hypnosis** – trance healing noted in Greek dream temples and Egyptian sleep sanctuaries, refined by modern science.
- **EMDR** – Francine Shapiro's 1987 eye-movement method for processing trauma.
- **Brainspotting** – David Grand's technique linking fixed gaze points to emotional release.

Ancient paths from Greek philosophers, Celtic druids, and the priests of Hathor weave into this lattice of healing.
