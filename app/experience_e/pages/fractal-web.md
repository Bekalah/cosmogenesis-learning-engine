You step into the **Global Healing Web**.
Threads glimmer with stories from Tibetan Reiki, Usui and Karuna lineages, Egyptian Seichem and SEKEM, hypnosis, brainspotting, EMDR, and the ancient rites of Greeks, Druids, and Hathor's temple.
Each node invites you to follow a lineage and celebrate its wisdom.
