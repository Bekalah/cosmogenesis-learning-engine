# Documentation Map

Use this folder as the living research spine for Cosmogenesis.

- `covenant/` — ND-safe rules and provenance obligations.
- `pantheon/` — dossiers on key guardians, artists, and archetypes.
- `codex-14499-research.md` — complete research guide for the Codex 144:99 lattice.
- `archive/` — legacy READMEs and long-form drafts preserved for context.
- `style/`, `ateliers/`, and other subfolders keep specialized notes for builders.

Always archive rather than delete so future stewards can trace lineage.
