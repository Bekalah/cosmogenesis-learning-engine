# Modular Pedagogical Design (Codex 144:99)

This scroll braids numerology, lineage octagrams, and Liber Arcanae archetypes into a modular research OS. Each entry honours the PROTECT covenant: ND-safe pacing, layered geometry, provenance-first storytelling, and offline-first delivery. Learners choose their own narrator by toggling Liber Arcanae filters, octagram lineages, and numbered capsules; every asset references CC-BY/SA or companion provenance JSON so scholarship and play remain inseparable.

## Method Overview

- **Modular Pedagogical Anchors:** Nodes 00–144 act as micro-ateliers mixing numerology reductions, symbolic cognition, and open-source assets. Each capsule documents roots, style, belief, psyche healing arc, crystal anchor, and a playable ritual so research memos double as experiential puzzles.
- **Cross-Modal Integration:** Liber Arcanae archetypes serve as OS filters linking art/music generators, chapel environments, avatar interfaces, and behavioural effects. Learners can route to their preferred narrator (angel, poet, engineer, or witch) without breaking lineage fidelity.
- **Live Ritualized Research:** Updates publish as scholarly dossiers that are simultaneously games—protective seals become save points, colour-tone puzzles teach synesthetic logic, Soyga tables drive angelic math labs.
- **Open Source + Provenance:** Every layer maintains CC-BY/SA licensing and provenance JSON threads, echoing the repository's provenance.md and registry maps.
- **Modern Hooks:** AI-adjacent art/music tools stay local and opt-in, neuro-aesthetics guide palettes and pacing, trauma-aware design ensures undo/safe-stop controls, and the Octagram Tesseracts provide lineage toggles reminiscent of modular ed-tech dashboards.

## I. Numbered Node Capsules (0–144)

## Stewardship Notes

- Embed provenance JSON alongside every scroll, banner, and node update so citations remain trivial.
- When loading offline (`file://`), lean on the cosmic-helix renderer for layered vesica, Tree-of-Life, Fibonacci, and helix lattices; these constants feed ritual geometry without network calls.
- Maintain PROTECT checkpoints: pause buttons, intensity sliders, consent prompts, and ND-safe palettes.
- Continue weaving Soyga tables, Liber Arcanae archetypes, angelic correspondences, and trauma-aware rituals into open repositories so research stays both citable and playful.
