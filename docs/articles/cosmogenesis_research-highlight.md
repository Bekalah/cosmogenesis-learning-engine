## Research Context

The Cosmogenesis Learning Engine synthesizes cross-disciplinary insights to build modular, trauma-informed interfaces that honor neurodivergent needs. By pairing scientific rigor with artistic exploration, the project advances a living architecture capable of adapting to varied learning modalities.

## Highlights

- **Living Architecture:** Modular nodes mirror the Living Arcana schema, enabling practitioners to map correspondences between traditional symbols and contemporary disciplines.
- **Parallel Engine Strategy:** Stride and MonoGame sandboxes run side-by-side, empowering rapid experimentation without disturbing legacy implementations.
- **Trauma-Informed UI:** Accessible color palettes, gentle contrast, and zero-motion rendering respect sensory safety requirements.
- **Research-Oriented Launcher:** Feature flags toggle ECS, instancing, LOD, and streaming so researchers can gather comparable performance metrics.

## Citation & ORCID Notes

This highlight integrates public artifacts and repository references for straightforward citation. ORCID metadata is embedded in the front matter so scholarly aggregators can ingest author identity with minimal friction.

## Next Steps

1. Expand Living Arcana datasets to include additional practitioners and narrative branches.
2. Iterate on ECS systems for both Stride and MonoGame sandboxes to gather performance data at scale.
3. Publish modernization metrics documenting render-path deltas and ND-safe accessibility outcomes.
