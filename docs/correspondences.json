# ✦ Correspondences

`data/correspondences.json` collects symbolic bridges between systems.  
The initial `chakra_planet` set links the seven primary chakras of yogic
tradition with the seven classical planets used in Western astrology.

| Chakra | Planet | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Muladhara (Root) | Saturn | Grounding and structure |
| Svadhisthana (Sacral) | Jupiter | Growth and flow |
| Manipura (Solar Plexus) | Mars | Willpower and action |
| Anahata (Heart) | Sun | Vitality and center |
| Vishuddha (Throat) | Venus | Harmony in expression |
| Ajna (Third Eye) | Mercury | Insight and communication |
| Sahasrara (Crown) | Moon | Receptivity and cycles |

To extend this file:

1. Use descriptive keys (`chakra`, `planet`, `note`).
2. Keep the JSON valid and human readable.
3. Add new arrays for other correspondence sets (e.g., elements ↔ virtues).

Refer back to this document when introducing new terms so contributors
understand how to weave additional mappings.
