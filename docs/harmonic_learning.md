The Harmony Engine lets learners translate study nodes into musical harmonics. Each node becomes a note in a Solfeggio scale so patterns can be heard as chords or recorded for later playback.
The Harmony Engine lets learners translate study nodes into musical harmonics. Each node fires its own note from a chosen scale so patterns can be heard as chords or recorded for later playback. Modes include:

- **auto-art** – triggers visual events for generative art.
- **auto-music** – plays notes for sonic feedback.
- **art-music** – combines both art and music reactions.
- **collage** – mixes Solfeggio, pentatonic, raga, and maqam scales for cross-cultural harmonies.

These studies explore how patterned sound influences cognition and wellbeing, grounding the engine in current neuroscience and music therapy practice.
