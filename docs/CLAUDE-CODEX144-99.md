# CLAUDE-CODEX144:99 — Numerology Covenant

Constants guiding the octagram tesseract implementation. All modules reference these numbers to maintain harmonic relationships.

- **21 Pillars** — Structural columns aligning chapel seals and planetary correspondences.
- **33 Spine** — Central axis spacing for the Tree-of-Life scaffold, referencing vertebral symbolism.
- **72 Shem** — Angelic chorus count; ensures angel correspondences remain within ND-safe invocations.
- **78 Archetypes** — Tarot majors and minors; nodes draw canonical labels from this pool.
- **99 Gates** — Spiral lattice thresholds; helix rungs and octagram edges respect 99 as a capstone count.
- **144 Lattice** — Canvas height segmentation and numerology base unit.
- **243 Completion** — Spiral iterations cease before exceeding 243 harmonics to avoid overstimulation.
- **Golden Ratio** — Applied to Fibonacci curve sampling and radial offsets.

Every render call notes these constants in comments to explain why geometry remains layered, calm, and trauma-informed.
