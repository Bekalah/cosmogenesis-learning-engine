+
+This document outlines the intent to maintain an index of open source art assets for the Cosmogenesis Learning Engine. It will gather permissively licensed images, audio, and other media that contributors can use when building lessons and realms. Each entry will record the source, license, and suggested applications so creators can easily locate resources that resonate with the project's ethos of accessible, living art.
