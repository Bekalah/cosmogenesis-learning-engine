# Neurodivergent & Trauma-Aware Learning

This guide summarizes design considerations for learners with ADHD, autism, PTSD, or hemispheric processing differences.

## Principles
- **Safety first** – predictable motion and user-controlled pacing reduce stress responses.
- **Spiral repetition** – revisiting material from multiple angles aids pattern integration and memory.
- **Multimodal synthesis** – combining text, image, and spatial layout engages both cerebral hemispheres.
- **Optional stimulation** – animations and color saturation can be toggled to prevent overload.
- **Playful mastery** – game-like plate building taps dopamine pathways that support motivation.

## Resources
- Bessel van der Kolk, *The Body Keeps the Score* – trauma and learning safety.
- Temple Grandin & Richard Panek, *The Autistic Brain* – sensory processing insights.
- Michael Gazzaniga, *The Ethical Brain* – hemispheric specialization and integration.

These notes are a starting point; contributions and corrections are welcome.
 
## Adaptive Spiral Codex (144:99)
- Experimental module that mirrors chronic PTSD processing loops to iteratively improve.
- Fuses science, psychology, healing, and art so learners can explore special interests without losing quality.
- Open-ended playground that rebuilds joy pathways through creative focus and curiosity.
