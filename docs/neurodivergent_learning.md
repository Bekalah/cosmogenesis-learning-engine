+# Neurodivergent & Trauma-Aware Learning
+
+This guide summarizes design considerations for learners with ADHD, autism, PTSD, or hemispheric processing differences.
+
+## Principles
+- **Safety first** – predictable motion and user-controlled pacing reduce stress responses.
+- **Spiral repetition** – revisiting material from multiple angles aids pattern integration and memory.
+- **Multimodal synthesis** – combining text, image, and spatial layout engages both cerebral hemispheres.
+- **Optional stimulation** – animations and color saturation can be toggled to prevent overload.
+- **Playful mastery** – game-like plate building taps dopamine pathways that support motivation.
