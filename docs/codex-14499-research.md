Core Identity
•Numerology Frame:
•Codex spine = 144:99 (Sacred square × angelic resonance).
•Aligns to Jacob’s Ladder / Double Tree of Life.
•Each node = harmonic: Platonic solid + Solfeggio frequency + planetary key.
•Nodes can be paired/fractaled like Indra’s Net → art ⇄ music ⇄ environment.
•Thelemic Lineage:
•Core Motto: Ordo in aeternum resonat → 99 (infinite angel resonance).
•Atelier Motto: Ex umbris in lucem artis → 93 (Love/Will).
•Seal Motto: In umbris clavis vigilat → 1496 → 2 (Guardianship).
•Thrones / Archetypes: Moonchild 2000, Ann Abyss, IGNI, Gemini, Virelai Ezra Lux, Zidaryen, Bea Betwixted, Mirror Witch, Ledger of 21 Pillars .
•Harmony = 93 + 99 + 2 = 8 → Infinity & Balance.

Architecture
•Cathedral of Circuits = Living grimoire.
•Chambers: chapels/, crypt/, apprentice-pillar.html , nave/, tower/.
•Engines: cosmogenesis-learning-engine/, cathedral-helper.js (ND-safe audio, accessibility flags, rubric scoring, plaque badges) .
•Grimoire Data: JSON dataset of 144 nodes, each fully locked (no stubs).

Dataset Anatomy (per node)
•id: 001–144
•name / title
•ego: archetypal resonance
•shem / goet: angelic & demonic correspondence
•gods / godd: list of deities from multiple cultures (Greek, Egyptian, Norse, Yoruba, Hindu, Celtic, Druidic, Mesoamerican, Shinto, Sumerian, etc.)
•chakra, planet, zodiac, element, solid
•sf: Solfeggio frequency
•music: { rn (root note), sc (scale), bpm, inst (instrument palette) }
•col: { p, s, a } → palette (primary, secondary, accent)
•art / geo: symbolic art/geometry overlays
•heal: { nd: true, ptsd: true, v: voice, snd: sound }
•tags: thematic index

These keys drive visuals, audio, environments, and narrative choices.

Cultural Flavor Toggles

Each node can dynamically “skin” into cultural idioms:
•Greek/Egyptian/Hermetic: Hermeticism, alchemy, Thoth/Hermes, Isis.

Tradition Currents & Dynamic Upgrades

✦ Reiki (Advanced Usui)
• Direct channeling: each node can self-attune new energetic systems.
• Attunements as CYOA nodes: three-stage branches mirror initiatory choices.
• Energy "flavors": Tarot and angel currents register as distinct flows.

✦ Sepher Sephiroth (Crowley / Gematria)
• Hebrew letters gate nodes as numbers and elemental keys.
• Elevens, twenty-twos, and thirty-threes act as portal rooms in the 144 lattice.

✦ Regardie (Golden Dawn)
• Rituals function as therapy, reinforcing ND-safe play.
• Color scales, tattwas, and scrying provide ready art modules.

✦ Goetia (Rufus Opus)
• Seventy-two daemons pose paradox riddles and initiatory tasks.
• Circles, triangles, and spirit pots translate to geometry and fusion rites.

✦ Agrippa
• Each node invites multiple interpretations to avoid dogma.
• Mirrors the Renaissance tension between skepticism and magic.

✦ Paul Foster Case
• Tarot encodes a helix cipher of seven unfoldment stages.
• ROTA wheel anchors macro arcs within the thirty-three-chapter spine.

✦ Jodorowsky (Psychomagic)
• Mystery rooms prescribe symbolic acts for healing.
• Performance serves therapy rather than spectacle.

✦ Alchemy (Frater Albertus)
• Labs blend planetary hours, tinctures, and layered geometry.
• Body, mind, and soul align with Stone, Cosmogenesis, and Circuitum99.
