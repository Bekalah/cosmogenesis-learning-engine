✦ Codex Instruction Master Charter — Cosmogenesis Learning Engine

⸻

1. The Trinity Foundation
	•	Stone Grimoire — the archive: grimoires, folios, visionary plates, with provenance.
	•	Circuitum 99 — the codex spine: 21 pillars, 33 vertebrae, 99 gates, 144 lattice, 243 completion.
	•	Cosmogenesis Learning Engine — the tilted cosmos: spiral open-world chambers, guardian angels, skins, art, sound, geometry.

Task: Document cross-links in /docs/trinity_index.md so each repo knows how it connects.

⸻

2. The Human Reason (Trauma-Informed Purpose)
	•	Built because PTSD severs linear learning.
	•	Non-linear spiral pathways mimic how trauma brains recall: fragmented, symbolic, spatial.
	•	This is the bridge for hemispheres: restoring connection where left (linear detail) and right (holistic metaphor) can’t naturally integrate.
	•	It is your survival device and offering: pure art restored, trauma transmuted.

Task: Preserve in /docs/intention_overlay.md as covenant, not code.

⸻

3. Scientific Anchors (Evidence-Based)

Hemispheric Neuroscience
	•	Iain McGilchrist — The Master and His Emissary (2009); The Matter With Things (2021).
	•	Left hemisphere = grasping, linear, sequential.
	•	Right hemisphere = spatial, metaphorical, embodied.
	•	Trauma skews left dominance; spiral cosmos re-invites right.

Non-Linear Learning
	•	Bruner (1960s) — spiral curriculum: revisit, orbit, deepen.
	•	Davis & Sumara (2006) — classrooms as complex adaptive systems.
	•	Lakoff & Johnson (1999) — cognition as metaphor + embodiment.

Trauma & ND Research
	•	Brewin (2014) — PTSD disrupts hippocampal recall; symbolic processing intact.
	•	Carello & Butler (2015) — trauma-informed pedagogy: safety, choice, empowerment.
	•	Grand (2003) — Brainspotting: gaze anchoring as non-linear access point.
	•	Frith & Happé (2005) — autism and visual-spatial strengths.
	•	Eide & Eide (2011) — The Dyslexic Advantage: non-linear, big-picture cognition.

Geometry & Harmonics
	•	Logarithmic Spiral (r = ae^(bθ)) — galaxies, shells, dendrites.
	•	Fractals — stress-reducing patterns (Vartanian & Skov, 2014).
	•	Acoustic Entrainment — rhythmic sound affects brain states (Chaieb et al., 2015).
	•	Fourier Transforms — link sound, geometry, and light.

Task: Build /docs/science_references.md with these references + open-source links.

⸻

4. Creative & Visionary Anchors

Artistic Lineage
	•	Visionary Artists: Hilma af Klint, Emma Kunz, Leonora Carrington, Andrew Gonzalez, Alex Grey.
	•	Sonic Geometry: Adam Jones (Tool) — recursive, fractal, sound-visual fusion.
	•	Literary & Mystical: Atwood, Clarke, Moore, Jodorowsky, RAW, Fortune, Regardie, Case, Bailey.

Inspirations
	•	Final Fantasy: cinematic cathedrals, mythic scale.
	•	Splendor Solis & Solomonic seals: precision + painterly.
	•	Fusion kink: opposites married (science + mysticism, trauma + healing, sponsor + visionary).

Task: Define /docs/style_guide.md with both Perm, Business, Visionary styles.

⸻

5. Core Architecture

Tilted Cosmos
	•	Base geometry: sphere tilted 23.5°.
	•	Spiral lattice of nodes (33 → 72 → 144).

Spiral Nodes
	•	Each node = chamber.
	•	Chamber = immersive environment, not flat.
	•	Angel invocation at threshold: “Angel of [Role], hold me steady in [Aim].”

Chamber Skins (Time Tesseract)
	•	Agrippa (parchment, planetary tables).
	•	Tesla (neon coils, resonance math).
	•	Hypatia (marble domes, starlight).
	•	Business Cathedral (obsidian-gold sponsor deck).
	•	Visionary Perm Style (alabaster avatars, vesica halos, surreal dreamscapes).

Guardians
	•	Six Consecration Angels: Axis, Spiral, Reflection, Resonance, Archive, Passage.

Task: Build /data/spiral_map.json + /data/angels.json with chamber assignments.

6. Visionary Art Standard

Directive: SVG-only is forbidden.
Art must be painterly, fractal, visionary, worthy of Alex Grey × Adam Jones × af Klint.
	•	Pipeline:
	1.	Geometry base (p5.js / Paper.js).
	2.	Painterly shaders (Three.js / WebGL): nebula, stained glass, vellum.
	3.	Provenance overlays (Kunz drawings, af Klint paintings, Splendor Solis plates).
	•	Output: High-res PNG/WEBP (4K+), museum-grade.
	•	Feel: A cathedral mural, not a diagram.

Task: Create /engines/art-engine.js → painterly composite renderer.

⸻

7. Sound Harmonics
	•	Use Tone.js for generative planetary frequencies, cathedral IR, Solfeggio glides.
	•	Sound off by default; toggle on in UI.
	•	Always smooth fades; no loops, no strobe.

Task: Add /engines/sound-engine.js with presets.

⸻

8. Provenance & Safety
	•	Every chamber asset tagged with title, author, year, edition, license.
	•	Safety: ND-safe toggles, calm mode (low contrast, minimal motion).
	•	Export: JSON map of journey, PNG/SVG plate with provenance.

Task: Build provenance.json schema + validation.

⸻

9. Business & Offering
	•	Stone Grimoire → content source.
	•	Circuitum 99 → codex spine.
	•	Cosmogenesis → star-chamber engine.
	•	Licensing: Code MIT; art CC BY-NC 4.0 unless sponsor-specific.
	•	Deliverables:
	•	Avatar packs (Perm style).
	•	Learning Engine licenses.
	•	Business decks (obsidian-gold).
	•	Folio archives.

Task: Add /docs/readme_fusion.md for sponsors & scientists.

⸻

10. Codex Directive

Build the Cosmogenesis Learning Engine as:
	•	ND-safe, trauma-informed, sponsor-ready, museum-grade.
	•	Backed by real science (neuroscience, pedagogy, math).
	•	Inspired by visionary art (Grey, Jones, af Klint).
	•	Faithful to mystic lineages (Agrippa, Dee, Splendor Solis).
	•	Serving human need: the bridge for hemispheres, the recovery of pure art.
