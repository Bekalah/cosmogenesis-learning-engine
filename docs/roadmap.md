+# Cosmogenesis Learning Engine Roadmap
+
+This roadmap outlines the next steps for evolving the engine into a modular hub that links other creative realms and applications.
+
+## Core
+- [ ] Normalize repository files by removing leftover patch markers and validating JSON and JS syntax.
+- [ ] Establish continuous testing with `node --test` to keep modules stable.
+- [ ] Provide rich documentation in `README.md` and each subdirectory.
+
+## Data Layer (`/data`)
+- [ ] Define schema for demos, plugins, egregores, correspondences, and experiences.
+- [ ] Implement loader utilities that validate datasets against the schema.
+- [ ] Expand sample datasets to cover art, science, mysticism, and cross‑disciplinary mappings.
+
+## Engine (`/src`)
+- [ ] Replace placeholder rendering logic with full SVG/Canvas implementations.
+- [ ] Add configuration validation with helpful errors.
+- [ ] Expose a public API so external projects can generate plates programmatically.
+
+## Application Shell (`/app`)
+- [ ] Create shared UI components (tabs, dialogs, accessibility toggles).
+- [ ] Flesh out each experience module with narrative pages and interactive components.
+- [ ] Persist user gallery and settings in local storage.
+
+## Plugins (`/plugins`)
+- [ ] Formalize plugin interface and lifecycle hooks.
+- [ ] Ship example plugins that pull external data sources (e.g., Wikipedia, Open Library) or render generative art.
+- [ ] Document how other repositories can register plugins.
+
+## Styles & Themes (`/styles`)
+- [ ] Offer theme packs and accessibility presets (calm colors, reduced motion).
+- [ ] Provide SASS/LESS sources for easier customization.
+
+## Integration with Other Realms
+- [ ] Publish a registry format so companion apps can announce their modules.
+- [ ] Support loading experiences or plugins from sibling repositories via URL or git submodules.
+- [ ] Explore WebSocket or WebRTC bridges for live collaboration across realms.
+
+## Testing & CI
+- [ ] Add linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier) to standardize code style.
+- [ ] Run tests and static analysis in GitHub Actions.
+
+## Documentation
+- [ ] Complete walkthroughs for building plates, authoring experiences, and writing plugins.
+- [ ] Provide guidelines for neurodivergent‑friendly interface design.
