# Realm Blends

To craft bespoke learning environments, mix motifs from the three aesthetic realms.

- **Cathedral × Visionary** — stained glass diagrams bathed in soft celestial hues.
- **Visionary × Neon** — feminine curves traced with rebellious neon runes.
- **Cathedral × Neon** — Gothic structures wired with techno-occult circuitry.

Each blend balances style, elegance, intelligence, innovation, and luxury, guiding the engine's aesthetic synthesis.
