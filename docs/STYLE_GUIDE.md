# Cosmogenesis Style Guide

## Typography
- Prefer UTF-8 characters; use **em dash (â€”)** for long breaks.
- Heading levels should progress incrementally with a blank line above each.

## Color Palette
- Reference hues from `data/palette.json` and `data/stylepacks/stylepacks.json`.
- Favor luminous indigo, electric violet, auric green and golden amber to echo Codex 144:99.

## JavaScript Style
- Indent with two spaces and terminate statements with semicolons.
- Use arrow functions and module syntax (`import`/`export`).

## Python Style
- Indent with four spaces.
- Comment major steps and save rendered art as `Visionary_Dream.png` when applicable.

## Assets
- All exported images should include descriptive alt text in accompanying docs.
- Default art resolution: **1920x1080** unless otherwise noted.
