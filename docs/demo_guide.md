- ## ✦ How This Guide Works
- This is not a linear manual.  
- It is a **spiral walk-through**: each turn revisits the same engine with deeper complexity.  
- 
- - **First Spiral** → learn the surface (layout, labels, export).  
- - **Second Spiral** → weave correspondences (datasets, traditions).  
- - **Third Spiral** → fuse art, archive, and provenance into living plates.  
- 
- Each spiral is a *return* — not a reset.
