 ## ✦ How This Guide Works
-This is not a linear manual.  
-It is a **spiral walk-through**: each turn revisits the same engine with deeper complexity.

 Each spiral is a *return* — not a reset.

 ## ✦ First Spiral — The Basics
-1. Open the [engine](../index.html).  
-2. Choose **Layout** = Spiral.  
-3. Enter 7 labels (colors work well):  
1. Open the [engine](../index.html).
2. Choose **Layout** = Spiral.
3. Enter 7 labels (colors work well):
   `Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Violet`
4. Click **Render** to draw the plate.
5. Use **Export → PNG** to save your first spiral.

### Reset
Hit **Reset** to clear the plate and try new labels or layouts.

## ✦ Second Spiral — Correspondences
1. Load a dataset from `data/rooms.json` such as *Agrippa*.
2. Notice how the same geometry now expresses a different tradition.
3. Toggle **Style** to switch palettes or themes.

## ✦ Third Spiral — Art & Provenance
1. Combine a dataset with an egregore card from `data/egregores.json`.
2. Add a provenance note in the **Border** field.
3. Export and share the JSON config with a friend for collaborative return.

Each spiral builds upon the last. Revisit earlier steps as new ideas emerge.
