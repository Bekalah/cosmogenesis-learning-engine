# ✦ Cosmogenesis Learning Engine — Demo Guide

_A spiral teacher for pattern literacy, creative practice, and living archives._

---

## ✦ How This Guide Works

This is not a linear manual. It is a **spiral walk-through**: each turn revisits the same engine with deeper complexity.

- **First Spiral** → learn the surface (layout, labels, export).
- **Second Spiral** → weave correspondences (datasets, traditions).
- **Third Spiral** → fuse art, archive, and provenance into living plates.

Each spiral is a _return_ — not a reset.

## ✦ Sample Demos

Use the **Demos** tab or load `data/demos.json` to explore built-in presets:

- Art • 7 Colors (Basic Design)
- STEM • 12 Cranial Nerves
- UX • 22 Research Prompts
- Poetry • 33 Lines in a Cycle
- Sacred • 72 Names (Study Plate)
- Yeats • Twin Cones (Oppositions)
- Art • Visionary Dream

## ✦ First Spiral — The Basics

1. Open the [engine](../index.html).
2. Choose **Layout** = Spiral.
3. Enter 7 labels (colors work well):
   `Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Violet`
4. Click **Render** to draw the plate.
5. Use **Export → PNG** to save your first spiral.

### Reset

Hit **Reset** to clear the plate and try new labels or layouts.

## ✦ Second Spiral — Correspondences

1. Load a data
1. Load a dataset from `data/rooms.json` such as _Agrippa_.
>>>>>>>+Updated upstrea
ms.json`1. Load a dataset from `data/rooms.json` such as *Agrippa*.
>>>>>>>+Stashed changes
esses a different tradition.
3. Toggle **Style** to switch palettes or themes.

## ✦ Third Spiral — Art & Provenance

1. Combine a dataset with an egregore card from `data/egregores.json`.
2. Add a provenance note in the **Border** field.
3. Export and share the JSON config with a friend for collaborative return.

Each spiral builds upon the last. Revisit earlier steps as new ideas emerge.
