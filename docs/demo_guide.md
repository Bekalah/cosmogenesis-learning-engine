# Cosmogenesis Learning Engine — Demo Guide (Launch Edition)
Author: **Rebecca Respawn** (GitHub: @bekalah)  
Purpose: Give a **real, showable** way to run this tool live, teach with it, and prove value to professional creatives, educators, and sponsors.

## ✦ What You’re Demonstrating
Cosmogenesis is a **browser-native, zero-install** learning device that:
- Builds **plates** (Monad → Spiral → Ring → Border).
- Loads your **own datasets** (names, symbols, poems, correspondences).
- **Exports** print-ready SVG/PNG.
- Saves **galleries** locally and **shares configs** by link/JSON.
- Is **ND-safe** and accessibility-audited.
- Aligns with your *Stone Grimoire* standards (intention, technique, lineage, reflection).

> Touch of Rilke (for tone): “Go now and do the heart-work on the images imprisoned within you.”

## ✦ Before the Demo (5-minute checklist)

1. **Open the app**  
   - Double-tap `index.html` locally, or open your GitHub Pages link.  
   - Confirm the header shows “Cosmogenesis Learning Engine” and **tabs**: Build · Data · Demos · Gallery · About.

2. **Quality defaults**  
   - In **Build**: Mode=7, Turns=9, Samples=1600, Rᵢ=60, Rₒ=440, Node=28, Border=3, Style=Hilma Spiral.  
   - Tap **Randomize Phase** once to show gentle variability (no strobe).

3. **Accessibility**  
   - Tab focus rings visible, motion is opt-in, color contrast is legible on projector/phone.

4. **Sponsor-ready**  
   - About → read the small provenance plaque (Intention/Technique/Lineage/Reflection).  
   - Gallery → ensure it’s empty for a clean start.

## ✦ Demo Script A — “12 Zodiac in 120 Seconds” (Art/Design class)
**Outcome:** audience sees how fast they can learn and export a beautiful study plate.

**Steps**  
1. Go to **Demos** → click **“12 Zodiac · Rosicrucian”**.  
2. Switch to **Build** to show what changed (Mode=12, Style=Rosicrucian Black, labels prefilled).  
3. Click **Export SVG** → file saves as `cosmogenesis-plate.svg`.  
4. Click **Save to Gallery** → open **Gallery** to show the card with time stamp.  
5. Click **Copy Share Link** → paste in chat; anyone can open this exact plate in their own browser.

**Talking points**  
- “We just made a **curriculum artifact** in 120 seconds: clean SVG for print, poster, or slides.”  
- “This replaces hours of Adobe setup and licensing costs; it’s open and works offline.”  
- “Students can change the dataset to poetry, vocabulary, or project milestones in seconds.”

**Optional variation**  
- In **Data**: paste the class roster into “paste JSON” as `[“Ava”,”Noah”, ...]` → Apply → Build → Export.  
- Now you have a **team constellation** plate instead of zodiac—same geometry, new meaning.

## ✦ Demo Script B — “33 Living Spine” (Therapy/Coaching/Embodiment)
**Outcome:** show pattern literacy without retraumatization.

**Steps**  
1. **Demos** → **“33 Living Spine · Angelic Chorus”**.  
2. **Build** → lower Node size to 16, increase Samples to 3200 for a silkier spiral.  
3. **Save to Gallery** and **Export PNG** (for quick sharing).  
4. **About** → read the Reflection line: “Flat systems fail; spiral systems save.”

**Talking points**  
- “Clients see pattern instead of pathology; no autoplay or flashing elements.”  
- “We can attach gentle labels like ‘Vertebra 1…33’ or somatic anchor words.”  
- “The artifact becomes a **ritualized learning plate** for homework—print it, annotate it.”

**Optional**  
- Toggle “Ward Mode” (if you enabled it in your build) to demonstrate *calm frame* around the plate.

## ✦ Demo Script C — “Museum/Patron Showcase” (Brand-ready)
**Outcome:** present a sponsor-credible, museum-grade artifact.

**Steps**  
1. **Demos** → **“7 Planets · Classic”** (crisp, minimal).  
2. **Build** → set Border Width=4 for presence; Randomize Phase once.  
3. **Export SVG** and **Save to Gallery**.  
4. Open **About** and read the **Provenance Plaque** aloud (Intention/Technique/Lineage/Reflection).  
5. Explain **sponsor tiers**: custom palette, branded gallery, educational pack.

**Talking points**  
- “Every plate includes provenance, so your brand/curriculum isn’t orphaned.”  
- “SVG retains brand colors and scales to a building façade, poster, or letterpress.”

## ✦ Demo Script D — “Dataset Remix in 90 Seconds” (Creative Tech/Code)
**Outcome:** show JSON-driven flexibility for professionals and educators.

**Steps**  
1. **Data** → paste this into “paste JSON” and tap **Apply**:
   ```json
   [“Saturn — Thresholds”,”Jupiter — Expansion”,”Mars — Courage”,”Sol — Clarity”,”Venus — Coherence”,”Mercury — Transmission”,”Luna — Tides”]
