# Visionary Dream Generator

These steps keep things calm and clear:

1. **Install Python packages**
   - Run: `pip install pillow`
2. **Create the artwork**
   - Run: `python visionary_dream.py`
3. **View the result**
   - The image `Visionary_Dream.png` appears in this folder.

Feel free to pause between steps. Nothing moves or makes sound unless you choose to run it.
