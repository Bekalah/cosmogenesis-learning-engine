## Influence on Cosmogenesis

1. **Dream-cartography** &mdash; Carrington's paintings act as training diagrams for lucid myth-work. Their layered chambers inform the multi-room structure of the Cathedral modules.
2. **Feminine esoterica** &mdash; Her "militant mysticism" grounds the Tara matrices and ND-safe trauma alchemy practices.
3. **Animal allies** &mdash; Familiars such as hyenas and horses map directly to guardian nodes inside `registry/monad.json`.
