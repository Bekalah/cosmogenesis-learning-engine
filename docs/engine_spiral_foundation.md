# ✦ Cosmogenesis Engine — Spiral Foundation & Builder’s Guide

*A museum-grade, practical guide to how the engine teaches in spirals, how the geometry works, and how to extend it without breaking its dignity.*

## ✦ Core Idea — A Spiral Teacher (Not a Flat Syllabus)

Flat systems march: 1 → 2 → 3 → done.  
This engine returns: **Center → Spiral → Ring → Border → Return** — every pass reveals more structure.  
Pedagogically, that means:
- **Recursion over sequence**: you revisit the same set with new relations (labels, palettes, radii, layouts).
- **Progressive complexity**: small changes (turns, inner/outer radius, phase) produce qualitatively new insights.
- **Embodied safety**: Ward Mode, calm motion, legible contrast, no autoplay — usable under stress.

## ✦ Visual Grammar (Layouts)

The engine is **data-agnostic**. Layouts are just ways to *see* relations among items.

- **Spiral**: Center (Monad) emits a logarithmic/Archimedean arm; nodes sit on a circular ring.  
- **Twin Cones**: Two opposing arms/arcs symbolize tension of opposites; nodes divide across arcs.  
- **Wheel**: Pure perimeter constellation (no spiral line), good for taxonomies or cycles.  
- **Grid**: Centered matrix for quick scanning and line-of-sight comparisons.

All layouts share a **common border** (frame of reference) and a **monad** (center), so switching layouts preserves orientation: you are still in the same world, from a different angle.

## ✦ Geometry — The Spiral

### Archimedean spiral (default)
For samples `i = 0..N`, with `t = i/N`:
