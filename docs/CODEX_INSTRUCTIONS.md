# CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT ERASE OR OVERWRITE ‚ö†Ô∏è  
This file is the canonical design + build directive for Codex.  
It defines the **foundational intentions, protections, and visionary architecture** of the project.  
All contributions must align with these principles.  

‚Äî

## Purpose
This repo is a **living codex** ‚Äî Codex 144:99 (Alpha et Omega).  
It is an **immersive nonlinear learning environment**, designed as both:  
- üîÆ A *fusion art engine* (spiral, archetypal, experimental).  
- üß† A *creative healing tool* (support for PTSD, neurodivergence, reintegration).  

It mirrors the **33 Living Spine**, the **double Tree of Life**, and the **spiral monad system**.  
Every node, archetype, and lab in this environment exists to support users with curiosity, play, and restoration of authentic voice.

‚Äî

## Core Principles
1. **Never erase the foundation.**  
   - Original files, symbols, and design directives = *sacred bedrock*.  
   - Improvements must extend, not overwrite, intentions.  

2. **Spiral Dynamics.**  
   - Learning and creativity are **nonlinear**.  
   - Users move through **spirals, nodes, and archetypes**, not rigid curricula.  

3. **Archetypal Community.**  
   - Users are supported by **functional archetypes + egregores**:  
     - Consecration Angels (protectors + avatars of voice).  
     - Fusionist Towers (celebration of idealists, artists, thinkers).  
     - Archetypes & Daimons (IFS-style presence, but coded as guides, not therapists).  

4. **Experiential Labs.**  
   - Alchemy Lab, Fusion Lab, Audio/Binaural Lab = **immersive toolkits**.  
   - Labs combine science + art (cymatics, fractals, sound, light, geometry).  
   - Inspiration: The Witcher‚Äôs design depth, but more visionary, non-linear, and healing.  

5. **Immersive Analogies.**  
   - Spiral = Rabbit Hole / Red Pill / Wonderland.  
   - Monad system = nodal lattice (Terry Burns, John Dee, Alan Moore).  
   - Tools = visionary art meets math, mysticism, and creative coding.  

‚Äî

## Tech Directives
- **Engine Integration**  
  - Tesseract Viewer for spatial nodes.  
  - Cymatics Engine for sound/geometry fusion.  
  - Fractal Flame + Geometry modules for visual immersion.  

- **Assets**  
  - Use `/app/experiences/` for immersive journeys (A, B, C, D).  
  - Use `/app/shared/` for archetypal + symbolic components.  
  - Music = link to open-source type beats (Skeler, ofdream, etc.), *no local MP3s*.  

- **Code Rules**  
  - Always prefer modular, extendable code.  
  - Document functions so Codex never overwrites intention.  
  - Keep **archetypal mapping separate from core utilities** (e.g., angels.json, archetypes.json).  

‚Äî

## Meta-Instructions for Codex
- Do not ‚Äúsimplify away‚Äù symbolic design.  
- Do not add ritual frameworks ‚Äî this is an **artistic/educational engine**, not ritual magic.  
- Respect neurodivergent needs: clarity, nonlinear pathways, and supportive tone.  
- Output must be **museum-grade + visionary**: think *Adam Jones √ó Hilma af Klint √ó immersive app*.

## Final Note
This Codex exists because **life quality was reduced to 2% under oppressive learning systems**.  
It restores voice, curiosity, and joy for ND creators, fusionists, and idealists.  
Every commit must carry this intent:  
‚ú® *Do not erase the foundation. Extend it in alignment with spiral learning, archetypal support, and creative freedom.*
