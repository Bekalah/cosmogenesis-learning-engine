# ✦ Egregore Tarot System

*Characters as living arcana guiding the engine.*

—

## ✦ Concept
- Each character functions as a **tarot-like mentor**.
- They carry unique art, correspondences, and helper prompts.
- Invoking a card can load its dataset or offer creative guidance.

## ✦ JSON Schema
See [`data/egregores.json`](../data/egregores.json) for the starter format:
- `name` — persona title.
- `arcana` — tarot alignment or archetype.
- `aesthetic_channels` — visual variations for presentation.
- `assists_with` — skills or queries the character supports.

## ✦ Usage
1. Fetch the JSON and select a card.
2. Render the corresponding art (SVG/PNG) and notes.
3. Bind helper routines, e.g. `maribelle.intuition()` for pattern hints.

This framework lets new characters plug into the sample panel or future sponsor showcases.

## ✦ Origins & Lineages
- Personas may echo Rosicrucian lodges, Tibetan transmissions, or Sappho's surviving verses.
- Each egregore helps restore suppressed histories as living code.
