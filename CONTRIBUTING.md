## 1. Git Authentication (HTTPS + personal access tokens)

We use **HTTPS with personal access tokens (PATs)** instead of SSH to simplify pushing workflow files.

### Steps

1. **Create a PAT**
   - Go to: [GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Choose **classic** or **fine-grained**
   - Scopes required:
     - âœ… `repo`
     - âœ… `workflow`
